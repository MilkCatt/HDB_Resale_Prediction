### Step 1: Modify the Streamlit App

Add the following code to your Streamlit app section in `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from xgboost import XGBRegressor

# Load the trained model (ensure you have saved your model after training)
# For example, if you saved your model as 'xgb_best_model.pkl':
# import joblib
# xgb_best_model = joblib.load('xgb_best_model.pkl')

# Title of the app
st.title("HDB Resale Price Prediction")

# Input for date
input_date = st.date_input("Select a date", value=pd.to_datetime("2023-01-01"))

# Convert the date to the required format
date_numeric = pd.to_datetime(input_date).astype(int) / 10**9  # Convert to timestamp

# Prepare other features (you may need to adjust this based on your dataset)
# Assuming you have other features like 'feature1', 'feature2', etc.
# You can create input fields for these features as well
feature1 = st.number_input("Feature 1", value=0)
feature2 = st.number_input("Feature 2", value=0)
# Add more features as needed...

# Create a DataFrame for the input
input_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': [date_numeric],
    'feature1': [feature1],
    'feature2': [feature2],
    # Add more features as needed...
})

# Make prediction
if st.button("Predict"):
    prediction = xgb_best_model.predict(input_data)
    st.write(f"Predicted Resale Price: ${prediction[0]:,.2f}")
```

### Step 2: Save Your Model

Make sure you save your trained XGBoost model after training it. You can use `joblib` or `pickle` to save the model:

```python
import joblib

# After training your model
joblib.dump(best_xgb_model, 'xgb_best_model.pkl')
```

### Step 3: Run the Streamlit App

After making these changes, run your Streamlit app using the command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Summary

This modification allows users to input a date and other features to predict the resale price of HDB flats using the XGBoost model. Make sure to adjust the feature inputs according to your dataset and model requirements.
